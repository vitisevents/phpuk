Docker is not just about deploying containers to hundreds of servers. Developers need tools that help with day-to-day tasks and to do their job more effectively. Docker is a great addition to most workflows, from starting projects to writing utilities to make development less repetitive. Docker can help take care of many problems developers face during development such as “it works on my machine” as well as keeping tooling consistent between all of the people working on a project. See how easy it is to take an existing development setup and application and move it over to Docker, no matter your operating system.
