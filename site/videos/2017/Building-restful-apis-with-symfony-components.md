Built around the HTTP specification, Symfony components provide a rock solid foundation for building RESTful APIs, whether we are using the full framework or not. In this session we will see how to successfully deal with problems such as how to adapt our models to the desired representations back and forth, authentication strategies, some tips and tricks to test effectively our APIs and also how to apply these concepts to migrate effectively a legacy application, based upon real use cases.
