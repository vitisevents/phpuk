Everyone tells you that you need to test. You know the theory, but you don't know where to begin. What to test? What cases to write? Through realistic and pragmatic examples, this presentation will take you away from var_dump and ease you into the testing business until you're ready to do TDD. All this without losing sight of the tight deadlines.
