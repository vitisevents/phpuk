So, you want to use Docker and Kubernetes for your development but donâ€™t want to spend your days writing Dockerfiles and running Docker builds? In this talk you will learn how to deploy and manage applications using docker, kubernetes, and the open source OpenShift projects to truly simplify your development flow. Diving a bit deeper, we will learn how to use the Source 2 Image project to automatically build and deploy docker images straight from source code. After that, we will take it up a notch by learning how to add databases and scale the application to achieve fast response times for your users. At the conclusion of this talk, you will understand the workflow to build, deploy, scale and manage applications deployed using Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenShift. And just for giggles, we will also learn how to do A/B and Blue / Green deployments.
