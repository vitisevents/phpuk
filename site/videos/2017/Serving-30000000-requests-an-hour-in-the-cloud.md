You've written an application and now the worst thing that can happen to you has come about - People are using it! You now have load spikes to deal with. You can scale up to deal with the excess traffic, but what do you do when your load is variable? How do you do that, and stay on budget? This session is a case study on getting an App Engine app to scale to serve 30,000,000 requests an hour. It will take you through the architecture, the code changes and the technology trade offs to get to that level of traffic. And how to make sure your app scales down so running infrastructure to deal with potential traffic doesn't drown you.
