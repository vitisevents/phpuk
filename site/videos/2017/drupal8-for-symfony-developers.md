Drupal8 modernization (new object-oriented base) and adoption of many Symfony components is a huge step in connecting these two amazing communities and amazing projects. Drupal8 is not powered by full-stack Symfony and there is still many differences between these two relatives, but still, Symfony developers should master it easily. This talk is for Symfony developers who don't have experience with Drupal8. It will guide you through routing, controllers, hooks, events, Drupal Console, DI and many other interesting elements that power Drupal8 under the hood. It will also show how to build custom modules Symfony way.
