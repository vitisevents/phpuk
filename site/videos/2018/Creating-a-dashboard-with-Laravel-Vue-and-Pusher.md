Building a realtime dashboard is probably something every developer wants to do at one point. In this talk I'll explain how we leveraged both Laravel 5.5 and Vue to build the dashboard. After demonstrating the dashboard itself we'll take a deep dive in the code. We'll take a look at the entire flow: the grid system, how events are broadcasted using Pusher, some cool Vue mixins and much more. After this talk you'll be able to setup your own dashboard using our open sourced code.
