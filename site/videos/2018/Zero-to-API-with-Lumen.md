Do you want to build an API? You're not alone. Several tools exist to help you prototype an API with minimal effort on your part. In this talk, we'll make use of PHP and Laravel's Lumen framework to build an API using all of the bells and whistles of a framework without all of the full stack stuff we don't need. By the time attendees leave this talk, they'll have an overview of how they can use Lumen to create an API that they'll love maintaining and that users will love using. They'll also have an overview of API design best practices as well as a sprinkling of service-oriented architecture.
