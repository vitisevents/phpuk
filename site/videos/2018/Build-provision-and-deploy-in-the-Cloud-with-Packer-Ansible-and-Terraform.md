In a continuous integration and continuous delivery context, it is hard to reliably deploy code to an environment. When code commits also imply changes to your stack, it gets even more tricky. In this presentation I'll show you how to build vendor-agnostic cloud images using Packer and how to provision the necessary software dependencies using Ansible, including your PHP code. Once the image is in place, we'll use Terraform to deploy these images and create loadbalanced computing instances on various cloud environments in a single configuration format.
