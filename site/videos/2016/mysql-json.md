With the newly added JSON support in MySQL, you can combine the flexibility of NoSQL with the strength of a relational database. In this session, Morgan will explain the new JSON datatype, and the new set of functions for handling JSON documents, available storage and indexing options. In addition, he will present benchmarks showing how much one can expect from the MySQL server in different use case scenarios.
