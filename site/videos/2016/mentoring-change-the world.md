It's a tough world out there. There are so many new things to learn, and the list of need-to-know's changes every day. How do you keep up? How do you move ahead? Find a mentor - but wait! Isn't this a dog-eat-dog field where admitting you don't know something is the death of your career? Maybe back in 1995, but this is the new age of open source. Collaboration and sharing of information reigns. Find a mentor to help you excel, but more importantly, find someone to mentor. Being a mentor is challenging, rewarding, and keeps you on your toes. Learn what it takes to find a mentor, be a good mentor, and what tools can help you build your mentoring relationship.
