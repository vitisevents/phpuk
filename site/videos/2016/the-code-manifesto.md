The Code Manifesto is a set of values, created in hopes of guiding our community towards a place that is welcoming, safe, and empowering to all. Currently, our communities are greatly lacking in diversity, and sometimes outright hostile towards the minority members that we do have. In this talk I try to illustrate that problem, and also cover WHY it matters, and finally what we can do to help fix it.
