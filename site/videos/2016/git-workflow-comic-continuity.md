When helping companies improve their development practises, there are often conceptual sticking points - for example, rebase can be hard to understand and many people are wary of it. To help us better understand and communicate our workflows, I will illustrate Git concepts in the language of comic books, followed by a practical demonstration of the techniques.

This session has something to offer all Git users - from newcomers trying to get their heads around it all, to veterans trying to communicate a workflow to their colleagues. It should certainly spark an interesting discussion!
