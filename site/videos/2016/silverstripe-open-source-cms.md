The PHP-based CMS space is a highly competitive one. Incumbents with large communities vie with new entrants to battle it out in this contested space. And yet despite this, most of them just aren’t very good.

If you want to have a CMS that you actually enjoy using - no matter whether you’re a developer, a designer or a content administrator - you should probably be using SilverStripe.

Join Hamish Friedlander, CTO of SilverStripe, as he explains why what you’re currently using is awful, and how we can make your life better again.
