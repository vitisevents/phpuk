During this presentation, we are going to look at the new features that were introduced in PHP 8.1. Join me to have a look at how the type system is strengthened with Enumerations and “never”, Fibers, a new closure syntax, the First Class Callable Syntax, intersection types, and other new smaller features. At the end you will have a good understanding about all the new and exciting features that are part of the PHP 8.1 release.
