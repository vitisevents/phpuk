We sometimes talk about businesses contributing to open source as a philanthropic act, it’s much more than that. Business is an important part of a healthy open source ecosystem, and the benefits flow in both directions. In this talk we’ll discuss how open source participation can be rewarding for staff and for the bottom line. Lorna covers ways to get started without impacting delivery of the projects you’re already working on, ways to pitch this to higher-ups, and times when it might be better to ask for forgiveness rather than permission. PHP is in every organisation, and it’s a great example of a thriving Open Source ecosystem. This talk is for everyone who wants to see a bright future for technology, open source, individuals and businesses alike.
