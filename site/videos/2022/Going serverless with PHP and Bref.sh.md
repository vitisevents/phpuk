Learn how to build and deploy serverless PHP applications. During the workshop Mike explores Bref, a way to run PHP functions and HTTP APIs on AWS Lambda. He deploys and plays with a pre-built application, as well as explore how you can migrate your existing workloads. AWS DynamoDB is a highly scalable document/key-value store, which offers a lot of flexibility for developers with a steep learning curve. He covers the basics of this platform, and set you up to learn and develop more, whilst avoiding potential pitfalls that might hurt your production applications.
