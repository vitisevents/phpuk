Nowadays Kubernetes can run anywhere. On a developer machine, on premise, in a public cloud as well as on the edge. The common Kubernetes API makes it faster and easier to deploy workloads and manage network connectivity, storage, load balancing, security or service discovery. This allows you to leverage the best of all worlds and combine on-premise, private and public clouds to a hybrid environment that distributes your workloads as efficiently as possible. On the other hand, you quickly end up running not only one or two clusters, but dozens, or in edge and IOT scenarios even thousands or millions. In this talk Bastian will show how Rancher can help you to successful provision, manage and monitor these clusters, as well as the workloads running in them, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.
