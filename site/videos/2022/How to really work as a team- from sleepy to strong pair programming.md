So many people think that pair programming is a boring waste of time and effort. Stacy Cashmore is  here to explain how her team made it work, and what benefits they got out of it! She loves working in a team, bouncing ideas off each other and using their combined strengths to produce something that as individuals they wouldn't be able to come up with. One way she likes to do this is pair programming. Stacy shows you how they went from this sleepy type of pair programming to being super productive when working with multiple developers at one machine! Not the one person working, one person staring into space type of pair programming, but actually providing value to each other, making the extra effort worthwhile, and bringing extra benefits to the team as a whole.
