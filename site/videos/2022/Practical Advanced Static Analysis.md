All developers know that bugs are bad and finding them can be difficult. The good news is tools to help us find and prevent bugs are becoming more powerfulâ€¦ Modern static analysis tools (e.g. IDEs like PHPStorm and tools like Psalm, Phan and PHPStan) are far more advanced than their predecessors. They can find a whole range of bugs whilst keeping the false positive rate low. Dave's talk introduces more advanced static analysis. It will show the kinds of bugs that the more advanced static analysis tools can find. He will then look at how they can be added to your current development work flow and he'll finally look at how we can write our code in such a way to get the most out of static analysis.
