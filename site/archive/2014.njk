    bio: |
      Nate Abele first took an interest in programming at age 11, so you can obviously tell how cool he is. In the course of his career, he has mostly eschewed working for large companies, in favor of the culture found in small, independent businesses & startups. Nate has been employed by one of the most well-known and well-respected PHP consultancies in the world, and has worked on projects of all shapes and sizes. In other, more esoteric periods of work history, Nate has also worked with a humble 'productivity' software vendor in the greater Seattle area, and a small fruit vendor outside San José.

      However, Nate is probably best known for his contributions to Open Source, including helping to create one of the most well-known and widely-used web frameworks for PHP. The 5 years' experience working on a large, high-adoption project has helped to inform and guide his current crop of Open Source projects (he accidentally co-founded the <a href="http://lithify.me/">Lithium PHP framework</a>, and is a member of the AngularUI team), writing, teaching, and <a href="http://unionofrad.com/">consulting</a>.

      When not staring at glowing rectangles of various sizes, Nate enjoys eating delicious food, playing guitar, snowboarding, and writing about himself in the third person.
