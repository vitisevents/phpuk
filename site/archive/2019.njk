        "Chip is automating finances. We make it happen, whether ‘it’ is a wedding, a holiday, or a house deposit, whatever it is, we help people achieve their financial goals.
        <br><br>
        We’re not exactly a bank. We’re not exactly a savings account. We’re not exactly a lender. There's not a word for what we do, yet... We think we can find smarter ways to do a bit of all of the above. We work with your banking data to make you save smarter and borrow better.
        <br><br>
        Our face is a UX-led app with an active community supporting us as we grow. Behind the scenes, we plug into your bank account via OpenBanking APIs to automatically make tailored savings (and hopefully more things in the future), based on your spending habits and income.
        <br><br>
        We want everyone to be able to make the things they want happen and feel good about their money. We think the key to this is data and automation.
        <br><br>
        We’ve just broken the UK crowdfund record and are primed and ready to shake up the financial world. PHP is at the heart of what we do. Our core APIs are written in Phalcon and our new microservices take full advantage of Symfony components and awesome, modern, object oriented PHP.
        <br><br>
        Come chat to us if you like the sound of what we’re doing. We’ve got free stickers."

        <br><br>
        Mention Me's SaaS platform lets marketers create fully branded, flexible refer-a-friend programmes and our unique technology for AB testing and word of mouth tracking enables optimisation.

        <br><br>
        Mention Me raised $7 million in late 2018 and is rapidly expanding - we've grown from a team of 15 to over 70 in the last three years.
        <br><br>
        We love wrestling big technical challenges, and we have big aspirations. PHP is a huge part of our technology stack, and we're always on the hunt for great engineers to join us on our journey.

    bio: I have spent the last 13 years working in the software industry, I've written lots of different code including JavaScript, VB, C#, Bash, SQL and Python. I have spent the majority of my career writing PHP, I'm a massive fan of the community and attend many community events. I am currently a contractor and consultant specialising in PHP, Python and JavaScript. Prior to this I spent two and a half years at Breakthrough Media as Head of Technology where I managed a team of PHP developers working on WordPress and Laravel projects. Before Breakthrough I was a contractor and ran my own business. I had some success, I built an app that got my business mentioned in Mashable and on CNN, I then sold my business, and finally I nearly went bankrupt. It was a crazy, fun and depressing period. I learnt a lot though, for example, make sure you read and understand every line of a contract before you sign it. I'd advise everyone to try and run a business at some stage in their life. Overall I believe I have a great deal of insight and guidance to offer developers and aspiring technical managers. Not just based on my current role but also my previous business experience. I would love the opportunity to share my knowledge and experience with a wider audience. You can find out more about me via the following resources, you'll note I also have a degree in History which I hope shows I'm a well rounded individual.
